<h2>What Is Transit Oriented Development?</h2>
<p>
    Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a way of building the cities around
    transit-infrastructures. A TOD project is usually higher density, meaning
    that it is a more efficient use of land to house people, jobs and other
    activities. When TOD is applied to a community level, the area would be
    built to be pedestrian friendly so its residents can have easy access to
    public transit. The area would also be amenity rich, providing a range of
    services and job opportunities. Through TOD, a community will become a place
    where people can live, work, and play.
    <br>
    <br /><b>What is the benefit of TOD? </b><br />
    TOD allows people to reduce their reliance on cars for many errands. For instance,
    a resident can simply walk to a nearby grocery store to get groceries, bike a
    few blocks to get to the place where they are employed, and access the park nearby,
    all without having the need to rely on cars. Through reducing reliance on cars,
    people will not have to allocate a portion of their income to buy and operate
    a car. TOD encourages people to walk and bike more, which can in turn help people
    exercise, reducing the level of obesity and the diseases caused by it. It is
    also beneficial to our environment as we reduce the amount of carbon emissions
    and harmful air pollution particles that would cause respiratory issues.
    <br /> <br>
    TOD is also beneficial to city governments, as TOD would locate a large number
    of residents and jobs, which would encourage people to use public transit and
    justify the cost of operating these systems. By building more densely, cities
    will also reduce their operation and maintenance costs of their infrastructures,
    such as roads, sewage, water, and waste collection. For instance, 1 kilometre
    of road can service 50 houses (or 200 people, assuming 4 people per household)
    in a single-family community, where as 1 kilometre of road can service 2000 or
    more people in a transit-oriented community.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>
    Transit-Oriented Developments are defined as areas within 5-10 minutes walk to a transit service. In Ontario, this is equivalent to 500 to 800 metres. This widget compares data from <a
        href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/index-eng.cfm"
    >Statistics Canadaâ€™s </a> Census for the year of 1996 and 2021. 

Census data agglomerates data to multiple geographical areas, from city level data to the smallest and publicly available level, Dissemination Area level data, which is consisted of a few city blocks. This widget uses Dissemination Area to get the most accurate estimate of the census variables. Due to the boundary of 800-metre buffers do not align with Dissemination Area boundaries, we used areal interpolation to estimate the density of each variable within respective Dissemination Areas, then interpolate the data by the area that is within the 800 metre buffer. <br/>
</p>
<p>
    We generated points every 400 meters along transit-services in Toronto, then created 800-meter buffers around the generated points. Since transit stations are not 400m apart, We also used Thiessen Polygon to determine the closest station for each of the point we generated. 
    <br />

    All transit layers, including the transit line and transit stations, were
    downloaded from <a href="https://www.metrolinx.com/en/about-us/open-data">
